## 🚀 About Us
👋 Hey, we’re developers who love building things that actually work.
We’re a duo of self-taught developers passionate about turning ideas into real, usable products. Together, we co-founded Beap — a tool born out of our need to simplify development workflows and share insights visually and efficiently.

💻 We work with modern web stacks — JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS

🛠️ We build tools, websites, and experimental side projects that are fast, clean, and open-source

⚡ We love exploring new tech, learning in public, and making dev life just a little bit easier

🌍 Our goal: keep shipping cool stuff and contribute meaningfully to the dev community

We don’t just code — we iterate fast, design thoughtfully, and believe that great tools come from real problems.
